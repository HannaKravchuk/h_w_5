      <p>Nature photography is a terrific tool that helps you immortalize the fleeting moment before you. As a
        photographer and a nature enthusiast, you might encounter stunning scenes of nature that you wish to preserve as
        an artifact for years to come. Through this article, you will discover how to photograph nature at her disposal
        and the equipment required.</p>
      <p>Nature photography is a genre of photography that unlocks the beauty of natural elements in their natural
        habitat
        within a frame. It is an umbrella term that covers landscape photography, wildlife photography, and garden
        photography. The aspects of nature include a variety of subjects ranging from plants, animals, lush greenery in
        a
        personal backyard, to a hidden natural wonder that laughs with colors. Further, photographers can also capture
        the
        dynamics of seasons as they transition or highlight an environmental concern to call for immediate action, e.g.,
        photographing melting ice caps, extinction of animals, etc. </p>
      <p>A strong sense of passion and curiosity about the natural world influences your choice of subject. Your intent
        to
        tell a story through your photography skills combined with a fascinating subject, aids you in delivering an epic
        shot. </p>
      <p>Nature photography doesn’t require any sophisticated equipment. However, some of the essential gears that you
        must have to comfortably photograph includes:</p>
      <p>The moment you venture out, you must have all your equipment in one place. For this purpose, you may require a
        camera bag. Further, it provides you room to store those extra batteries and lenses for your journey. </p>
      <p>Capturing the elements of nature on her lap is not an easy task. Expect to encounter insects and other flies
        that
        may harm you. As a result, it is always a good idea to get yourself covered with gloves. Additionally, different
        shoes may be required to traverse varying landscapes. Another essential accessory is a hat that protects you
        from
        harsh direct sunlight. </p>
      <p>Since you will be getting to unknown places, it is good to equip yourself with a compass and an updated
        location
        map. Further, you can carry a lens hood to prevent glare while photographing on a sunny day. In case of rain, a
        waterproof camera cover will protect your camera. </p>
      <p>The crux of nature photography lies in capturing the scale and the specific details of an image. Therefore, you
        require a DSLR with a crop sensor. A DSLR with a crop sensor helps a photographer zoom-in to a specific area.
        This
        allows you to focus on your subject and record its details. Alternatively, you can also use your iPhone or
        Android
        device that features smaller apertures, dual lenses, and optical zooming to create compelling images. </p>
      <p>Wide-angle and zoom lenses are perfect choices for nature photography. However, despite the type, the lens’s
        size
        also impacts the quality of your resultant images. </p>
      <p>Image stabilization becomes a challenge, primarily when you shoot outdoors. Therefore, a tripod offers a handy
        solution to stabilize the camera. Further, it reduces the burden of holding on to the camera while you await
        that
        perfect moment. Additionally, it lets you capture the same shot for an extended period, resulting in prolonged
        exposure. </p>
      <p>The moment you choose your location for nature photography, you need to invest a reasonable amount of time
        knowing the rules and regulations that pertain to it. Additionally, it is always a good idea to keep someone
        informed about your whereabouts and time of return, even when a partner accompanies you. </p>
      <p>In your venture to capture the beauty of nature, you must be mindful of what you leave behind after your
        photography. Ensure you don’t leave any rubbish as it takes its own time to decompose. Further, the world you’re
        shooting is a living home to many living beings. Hence, refrain from any activity that will disturb the natural
        environment. </p>
      <p>Whether you shoot in a famous landmark or amidst a forest, always choose the golden hour for your shooting.
        There
        will be less crowd at a famous landmark during the early mornings or late evenings. Therefore, it lets you focus
        on these spots with ease. Further, if you are aiming to capture animals in the forest, it is during this time
        the
        animals get more active as the heat recedes. </p>
      <p>Since you will be shooting in RAW mode, you have to bring more light to your image. For this purpose, use the
        lowest ISO and adjust your shutter speed accordingly to compensate. </p>
      <p>You can create stunning images when your subjects reside in their natural habitat for nature photography. This
        brings in a sense of reality to your pictures, making them appear more realistic. </p>
      <p>You focus on a small-scale subject to capture its details. Hence, to let your viewer focus on the details of
        your
        subject, you need to remove the distracting elements of the scene. For example, you can leave a considerable
        distance between the foreground and the background before placing the details in the frame. Then, focus on the
        subject in the foreground and use a wide aperture of f/2.0 or f/2.8 to get a blurry or soft background. </p>
      <p>Nature photography is all about capturing everything in its raw form. Although shooting in RAW format occupies
        a
        significant memory card space, it is the best choice to capture nature as it appears. In addition, capturing RAW
        images gives you unprocessed final photos, which you can edit later. </p>
